### User Stories

##### New users:
* As a traveller, I want to find activities in Australia for my next holiday 
* As a traveller, I want to see what attractions are in the city where I think to spend my holidays, so I can decide what to do before I get there, for example, visit museums, parks..
* I want to visually compare locations of several hotels that I picked, checking with the map.
* As a traveller, I want to check out different restaurants that are nearby in the city where I travel, so I can choose one to visit soon.
* As a busy person, who spends almost all the time working, I have no time for planning my holidays, so I want to contact the Aussie Adventures team directly to discuss and organise my next holiday according to my personal preferences
