# Milestone 2 -Interactive Front-End 
# Aussie Adventures


Aussie Adventures is an application that uses Google Maps API to allow users to search for different types of activities and places (Parks, Diving, Surfing, Restaurants, Camping, Beaches) for their next holiday in Australia. The users can find things to do by clicking on the categories of activities or places. The application also allows the users to get detailed information (name, address, contact number, rating, website name and price level) of the chosen activity by clicking at the marker. 
The application contains a pull-out taking-notes app  for the user to save the details of places to visit or activities to do.

Also, the website gives the users overall information about Australia and provides a gallery of australian beauties.

As a starting point I used the image chosen for my landing page which helped to choose the color pallete for the entire website.
Below is a picture of the color palette I got off the website Coolors [https://coolors.co/]

![collage](design/collage.png)
I used different shades for some containers. I also used different opacities of the same colour to create a layering effect and give the design hierarchy.


 

**Typography**
* I used Google Fonts to select the fonts for my project. 
* Concerto One, cursive is used throughout the whole website for headings to give a modern look to the website and Montserrat.
